# Sales-Report
This piece of software helps you get real-time insight into your sales.If you track your sales through the [Square app](https://squareup.com/ca/en), this repo allows you to get visual insights into your sales. 

I developed this when I was volunteering for [Tirgan festival](https://tirgan.ca), where I was in charge of running a retail business for the festival and wanted to automate part of what I did. 

## Installation
As of now, you would have to clone the repository to your local machine. I hope to ship this as an executable file soon. For now,
```
git clone https://github.com/tarhang/Sales-Report.git
```
and create a virtual environment and install the dependancies.
